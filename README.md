# TaskFlow
A one stop solution for digital task and team management

## Overview

Navigating the complexities of dynamic and quick project management, real time communication requires
an efficient tool, and our platform rises to the challenge. From dynamic workflow creation to real-time
collaboration features, each element adds a layer of complexity that, when seamlessly integrated, forms an
attractive and comprehensive solution. The intelligent algorithms and advanced language models
contribute to the sophistication of the tool, positioning it as a game-changer in the realm of collaborative
project management. Our project aspires to be more than just a collaboration tool; it aims to be a catalyst
for innovation, efficiency, and success in the dynamic landscape of project management. Welcome to the
future of collaborative excellence.

## Tech Stack

List of Frameworks, and tools used in your project.

- Frontend: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- Backend: [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- Database: [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)

The project is built using a diverse set of technologies to provide a comprehensive and intelligent collaborative environment. The key components of our tech stack include:

1. **LangChain:**
   - LangChain is a powerful language processing library that enhances our project's capabilities in natural language understanding and task automation.

2. **Socket.IO:**
   - Socket.IO is employed for real-time bidirectional communication, enabling seamless and instant collaboration among team members.

3. **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):**
   - OCR technology is integrated into our project to enable the extraction and analysis of text content from images and documents, enhancing document processing and understanding.

4. **GPT-3.5 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer):**
   - GPT-3.5, developed by OpenAI, is used for advanced language modeling. It elevates the intelligence of the system by providing context-aware responses and aiding in dynamic workflow creation.


## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Workflow Creation:** Leverage LangChain and GPT models for automatic workflow creation.
2. **Intelligent Task Assignment:** Utilize an advanced algorithm for intelligent and context-aware task assignment.
3. **Real-time Collaboration:** Foster collaboration with features like real-time commenting and an interactive chatbot.
4. **MultiPDF Reader with LangChain and OCR:** Enhance document analysis with LangChain and OCR capabilities.
